    "Question 1: What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "API is the acronym for application programming interface - a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "API stands for application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word applications refers to any software with a distnict function. Interface can be thought of as a \n",

    "on hhow developers are to structure those requests and responses.\n",

    "Question 2: Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "1. Increased Interperability: API solutions enable different software systems to communicate with each other, regardless of thier programming language or platform.\n",
    "This enhances the interoperability between systems, allowing for the exchange of data and fuctionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Improved Efficiency: API driven infrastrucutres enable developers to rescue code and functionality from the existing software systems, saving time and reducing the amount of code \n",
    "that needs to be written from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Better User Experience: APIs can enable third-party developers to create applications that integrate with existing software systems, providing a better use experience and \n",
    "increased functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Increased Flexibility: APIs provide developers with greater flexibility, enabling them to choose the best programming languages and frameworks for thier needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. New Revnue Streams: APIs can enable companies to create new revenue streams by providing third-party fdevelopers with access to thier software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Security concerns: API infrastructures can be vulnerable to security breaches, such as SQL injection attacks and cross - site scripting(XSS) attacks, making it crucial to \n",
    "implement security measures to protect against these threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Complexity: APIs can be complex, requring a significant amount of development effort to implement and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compatibility Issues: APIs can have compatibility issues between different versions of the same software system or between different systems, which lead to errors and system \n",
    "failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dependency on Third-Party Developers: APIs rely on third-party developers to create applications that integrate with the software system. This can create dependiences that are \n",
    "outside of the control of the company that owns the software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Governance and Management: APIs require proper governance and managment to ensure they are being used correctly and consistently across different applications and systems."

    "Question 3: What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "Web API is an API as the name suggests, it can be accessed over te web using the HTTP protocol. it is a framework that helps you to create and develop HTTP based RESTFUL services.\n",
    "The web API can be developed by using different technologies such as java, ASP.NET etc. WebAPI is used in either a web server or web browser. Basically Web API is a development\n",
    "concept. It is limited to web Application's client-side and also it does not include a web server or web browser detalis. If an application is to be used on a distributed \n",
    "system and to provide services on different devices like laptops, mobiles, etc then WebAPI services are used. Web API is the enhanced from the web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "API vs Web service\n",
    "\n",
    "API and web service as a means of communication. The only differnce is that a web service faciliates intreaction between two machines over a network.\n",
    "An API acts as an interface between two different applications so that they communicate with each other. An API is a method by which the third-party vendors can write programs\n",
    "that interface easily with other programs. A web service is desingned to have an interface that is depicted in a machine-processable format usually specified in (WSDL).\n",
    "Typically, \"HTTP\" is the most commonly used protocol for communication. Web service also uses SOAP, REST, and XML-RPC as a means of communication.\n",
    "API may use any means of communication to initiate interaction between applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API exactly defines the methods for one software program to interact with the other. When this action involves sending data over a network, Web services come into the picture.\n",
    "An API generally involves calling functions from within a software program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of web applications, the API used is web based. Desktop applications such as spread sheets and word documents use VBA and COM- based APIs which do not involve web service.\n",
    "A server application such as joomla may use a PHP -based  API present within the server which does not require Web service.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Web serivice is merely an API wrapped in HTTP. An API does not always need to be web based . An API consists of a complete set of rules and specifications for software \n",
    "program to follow in order to faciliate interaction. A web service might not contain a complete set of specifications and somethimes might not be able to perfome all the tasks that\n",
    "may be possible from a comlete API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. All web sevices are APIs but all APIs are not Web services.\n",
    "2. Web service might not perfome all the opreations that an API would perfome.\n",
    "3. A Web service uses only three styles of use: SOAP, REST and XML-RPC for communication whereas API may use any style for communication.\n",
    "4. A Web service alway needs a network for its opreation whereas an API does not need\n",
    "5. An API interacts with two machines over a network wheras a Web service faciliates interfacing directly with an application.\n",
    "6. web service is like advanced Urls and API is Programmed Interface.\n",
    "7. API contains classes and Interfaces just like a program.\n",
    "8. A web service is a form of API (Application Programming Interface).\n",
    "9. An API is used by a computer programmer to establish a link between software applicationd. this interface can take several forms, a web service is just one of these.\n",
    "10. There are several types of web service. SOAP(simple object access protocol) is one of the most common. The API takes the form of a service description (WSDL) which is used \n",
    "to automatically generated the program code which makes the connection."

    "    SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol is a network platform used in a web service to exchange or communicate data between two different machines on a network.\n",
    "    It uses the XML format of data to transfer messages over the HTTP protocol. In Web services, SOAP allows the user requst to interact with other programming languages. in this way,\n",
